This is a bit of a throwback since it was actually painted in 2015. I was taking part in 
Dorset Art Weeks, an open studios event near my parents home at the time. I knew that 
the stream of visitors might be a little thin at times, so I thought I needed something to
work on during the long hours of waiting for visitors. I had an old photo lying around,
that I'd taken of my mother and one of my nephews, on a family day out, and the light in 
the photo was really beautiful, plus I'd wanted to experiment with painting subjects mostly 
in shadow, so I just set up my laptop next to an easel in the gallery space and started painting.

The event was spread over four days, and I did have some visitors (and even sold a couple of 
paintings!) but I had enough free time to paint the above.
