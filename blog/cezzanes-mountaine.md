This view is on the edge of Aix-en-Provence, just up the road from Cezanne's studio.
He painted the view many times. A quick [google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=cezanne+mont+st+victoire&oq=cezzane+mount+sy&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0.6416j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) on the subject will show you some of his many paintings of the mountain.

It's not hard to see why he like to paint from this spot so much. The depth of field in the view is 
incredible, and the atmospheric depth has a very clearly deliniated foreground, middleground and background.

Today there are cypress trees in the park, which I guess probably were not there in his day, and I actually 
had to leave a couple of them out, because they obscure the view somewhat. Who knows, may they were there is
Cezzane's day, and he just left them out too..
